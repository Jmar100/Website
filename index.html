  <h1>Jorge Martinez Rivera</h1>

  <p>
    Entry-level IT professional focused on troubleshooting,
    documentation, and user support.
  </p>

<p>
  I prioritize clear communication and structured problem-solving, especially
  when assisting users who are frustrated or unfamiliar with technical systems.
  I value thorough documentation and following established procedures to ensure
  issues are resolved consistently and escalated appropriately when needed.
</p>

<p>
  I am actively building hands-on experience in IT operations and security
  fundamentals while continuing to strengthen my technical and support skills.
